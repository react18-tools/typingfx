```

**_or_**

```bash
npm install typingfx
```

**_or_**

```bash

```

---

## 🔧 Usage

### ① Import Styles

> 🎨 Required for typing animation and cursor styling.

**In JSX (Next.js layout files recommended):**

```tsx
import "typingfx/dist/index.css";
```

**Or in global CSS:**

```css
@import "typingfx/dist/index.css";
```

---

### ② Basic Typing Animation

```tsx
import { TypeOut } from "typingfx";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <TypeOut
      steps={["Frontend Developer.", "React Enthusiast.", "Open Source Advocate."]}
      speed={25}
      delSpeed={40}
      repeat={Infinity}
    />
  );
}
```

---

### ③ Single-Step Typing

Need a one-off typing effect without using `steps`?

```tsx
export default function Example() {
  return (
    <TypeOut>
      I love {500} <strong>typingfx</strong>
    </TypeOut>
  );
}
```

> ⏱️ Use numbers inside JSX to insert pauses (in milliseconds) during typing.  
> ➖ Negative numbers delay deletion.  
> 🔤 Want to render the number instead? Wrap it with `String()` or use template literals.

---

### ④ Animate JSX & Rich Text

```tsx
<TypeOut
  steps={[
    <>
      Building with <strong>React</strong>
    </>,
    <>
      Deploying on <code>Vercel</code>
    </>,
    <>
      Coding like a <span className="emoji">💻</span>
    </>,
  ]}
  speed={30}
  repeat={3}
/>
```

## 🧪 Component Animation (Beta)

TypingFX supports animating React components using a typing and deleting effect. This feature is currently in **beta**, and feedback is welcome.

### ✨ Default Behavior – Typing Animation

By default, TypingFX assumes the component is **pure** and attempts to extract and animate its **JSX output**, treating it like static content. This provides a natural typing effect as if the component was written inline.

```tsx
<TypingFX>{<MyPureComponent />}</TypingFX>
```

This enables smooth, character-by-character typing that matches the surrounding text.

### 🧩 `componentAnimation` Prop

For components with side effects or dynamic behavior, you can control their animation using the `componentAnimation` prop:

```tsx
<TypingFX
  componentAnimation={{
    wrapper: "div",
    props: { className: "custom-wrapper" },
  }}>
  <MyComponent />
</TypingFX>
```

TypingFX will wrap the component with the specified element and apply:

- **Fade-in (typing)**: 5s
- **Fade-out (deleting)**: 3s

This disables JSX extraction and uses a wrapper-based animation strategy.

### ⚠️ Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Limitation

TypingFX cannot detect components in **SSR environments**. Thus, by default, SSR-rendered components are treated as normal content and animated using the default typing animation.

However, you can manually mark any DOM element to be treated as a component by adding a `data-tfx` attribute with any truthy value:

```html
<span data-tfx="true">Server-rendered content</span>
```

Combined with the `componentAnimation` prop, this enables custom animation support even for SSR-rendered output.

### 🎨 CSS Overrides

You can override the fade animation by targeting the default class names:

```css
.tfx_component.tfx_type {
  animation: myCustomFadeIn 2s ease-in;
}

.tfx_component.tfx_del {
  animation: myCustomFadeOut 2s ease-out;
}
```

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### ⏱️ Delays & Pauses with Numbers

You can embed numbers (e.g. `{1000}`) directly inside JSX (`steps` **or** `children`) to add typing or deleting delays:

```tsx
<TypeOut
  steps={[
    <>
      Hello{800}
      {-500}
    </>,
    "World!",
  ]}
/>
```

- `{800}` → pauses for 800ms while typing
- `{-500}` → pauses for 500ms while deleting

> ⚠️ **Important**: Numbers must be embedded directly as JSX expressions — not as strings.

If you want to display a number instead of pausing, convert it to a string:

```tsx
<>I waited {String(800)} milliseconds.</>
```

---

### ⚠️ Memoization Matters

~~To prevent unintended animation restarts on re-renders, **memoize** your `steps` or `children` using `useMemo`:~~

~~const steps = useMemo(() => ["One", "Two", "Three"], []);~~

```tsx
<TypeOut steps={steps} />
```

> `TypeOut` is memoized by default. Only changes to the `paused` prop trigger updates.
>
> To re-run the animation on other prop changes (like `steps`), either:
>
> - Toggle `paused` off and on, or
> - Change the `key` prop to force a remount and pick up new props

---

### 🧱 Multi-Line Typing Support

Each step can contain **multiple elements** like `<p>`, `<div>`, or fragments – `typingfx` will animate them line by line:

```tsx
<TypeOut
  steps={[
    <>
      <p>Hi there</p>
      <p>Welcome to TypingFX!</p>
    </>,
    <>
      <p>Hi there</p>
      <p>TypingFX is awesome!</p>
    </>,
  ]}
/>
```

> ✅ No need to split them into separate steps – group them as one step to animate fluidly across lines.

---

### 🚫 Avoid Layout Shifts on Delays

When inserting delays between block elements, prefer placing the delay **inside one block**, rather than between them:

```tsx
// ❌ Avoid: causes extra spacing
<>
  <p>Hi</p>
  {5000}
  <p>Hello</p>
</>

// ✅ Recommended
<>
  <p>Hi{5000}</p>
  <p>Hello</p>
</>
// or
<>
  <p>Hi</p>
  <p>{5000}Hello</p>
</>
```

---

### ✨ Control the Cursor

Want to hide the blinking cursor?

```tsx
<TypeOut noCursor>Hello, no cursor here!</TypeOut>
```

---

### 🌐 Seamless RSC & Next.js Support

No extra setup needed – `TypeOut` is already marked as a client component.

> ✅ Works out of the box with Next.js 14/15 and React Server Components (RSC).

---

## ❓ FAQ & Gotchas

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <strong>Why does the animation restart on every re-render?</strong></summary>

This usually happens when `steps` or `children` are _not memoized_, causing a new reference on every render.

✅ **Fix:** Use `useMemo` to ensure stable references:

```tsx
const steps = useMemo(() => ["Hello", "World"], []);
<TypeOut steps={steps} />;
```

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>📏 <strong>Why is there extra space when adding delays between elements?</strong></summary>

Inserting a delay like `{500}` **between block elements** (e.g. `<p>`) creates empty text nodes, leading to layout shifts.

❌ Bad:

```tsx
<>
  <p>Hi</p>
  {500}
  <p>Hello</p>
</>
```

✅ Good:

```tsx
<>
  <p>Hi{500}</p>
  <p>Hello</p>
</>
```

> 📌 **Tip:** Always place delays _inside_ a block to avoid glitches.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>🧩 <strong>Does it work with RSC & Next.js 14/15?</strong></summary>

Absolutely. `TypeOut` is already marked as a **client component**, so it works out of the box with:

- ✅ React Server Components (RSC)
- ✅ App Router
- ✅ Server-side Rendering (SSR)
</details>

---

<details>
<summary>⏪ <strong>How do I add delay during deleting?</strong></summary>

Use **negative numbers** like `{-500}` anywhere in the content.

- `{800}` → pause for 800ms while typing
- `{-500}` → pause for 500ms while deleting

```tsx
<TypeOut steps={["Start typing...", -1000, "Deleting now..."]} />
```

or

```tsx
<TypeOut>Wait before deleting me{-500}</TypeOut>
```

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>🎨 <strong>How do I animate styled or rich text?</strong></summary>

TypingFX supports JSX out of the box! You can mix `<strong>`, `<code>`, emojis, or even full components.

```tsx
<TypeOut
  steps={[
    <>
      Writing with <strong>style</strong>
    </>,
    <>
      Deployed via <code>Vercel</code>
    </>,
    <>💻 Happy Coding!</>,
  ]}
/>
```

> ✨ Fully supports React elements, fragments, and inline styles.

</details>
